I can't remember the last time I had a crush on someone. That sudden, heart-pounding moment of romance, followed by incredibly vivid and exciting fantasies. Last week, this unexpected feeling took me by surprise. I always thought I knew exactly what kind of person I was looking for, but the instantaneous romance truly turned me in. It was just a stare, and I found myself drenched in her blue eyes. I don't know much about her, we've met each other several times, mostly at coffee shops or for lunch . I don't know what triggered this feeling, but there's something irresistibly attractive about her that makes me want to know her better.

I've been obsessing in some romantic fantasies in the past few days. In these daydreams, she is uniquely captivating, the centre of all things interesting, warm, beautiful, and delightful, as if she were the most wonderful person in the world. Scenes from the moments we spent together keep replaying in my mind, the excitement when we discussed similar interests, the awkward blush when she ran into someone familiar at Empik, and the eye contact when we asked about each other's eye colours. At that moment, I saw butterflies.

These daydreams have persisted, and I find myself thinking about her unintentionally. We share some of our favorite reels on Instagram every day. Each time I receive a message from her, it brightens my day, and I can hardly believe that someone like me, who rarely dreams, is now dreaming of her. But upon waking, I realize that it's like living in a sad yet addictive dream. I know deep down that it won't happen, yet I can't help but indulge in these fantasies. Now that the dream is over, I must return to reality. I know these are just my fantasies, we don't truly know each other and we're cool now being friends. I shouldn't burst this bubble now.

I enjoy meeting her and chatting with her. Even though sometimes we don't understand what the other is saying, there's a certain quality she possesses that makes me interested. Perhaps now isn't the best time to tell her how I feel, but I will. I'll say, "I have a crush on you, and I want to know you more."

I get lost in your eyes.
